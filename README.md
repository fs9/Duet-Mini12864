# Duet-Mini12864
A simple adapter board for using Fysetc's Mini 12864 LCD with Duet 2 boards

RepRapFirmware 3.2 included support for ST7567-based displays, but there are wiring differences between the Duet 2 and Fysetc's Mini 12864 displays. To keep wiring straightforward, I designed this simple board that handles the redirections, which, I hope, will translate into a tidier electronics bay and make it easier to add a 12864 LCD for those who have a hard time wiring cables by hand.
